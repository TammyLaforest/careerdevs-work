Hi, Prof. Reece.  I am submitting it like this because it is functional, but I am leaving in all of my commented out code so I can work on it in the future without getting lost.  Thanks!

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

User Story: I can see whether freeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the freeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv channel.
User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
